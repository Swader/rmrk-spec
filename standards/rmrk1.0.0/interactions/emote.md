# EMOTE

React to an [NFT](../entities/nft.md) with an emoticon.

You can only EMOTE on an existing NFT (one that has not been [CONSUMEd](consume.md) yet).

## Standard

The format of a EMOTE interaction is `0x{bytes(RMRK::EMOTE::{version}::{id}::{emotion})}`.

- `version` is the version of the standard used (e.g. `1.0.0`)
- `id` is the [nft](../entity/nft.md)'s ID [computed field](../entity/nft.md/#computed-fields).
- `emotion` is the unicode of the emoji (e.g Unicode for party popper 🎉 is
  [1F389](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/🎉/).

### Undo Emote

A user can undo their emote by sending the same emote again. Thus, during consolidation of RMRK
states:

- a tool should consider an emote of type E on NFT N by user U to be absent if `n(U:E,N)%2==0`
- a tool should consider an emote of type E on NFT N by user U to be present if `n(U:E,N)%2!=0`

In other words, if there is an even number of emotes on an NFT by a single user, that user has NOT
emoted. If there is an odd number, that user HAS emoted.

Example:

- Alice gives thumbs up to `5105000-0aff6865bed3a66b-DLEP-DL15-0000000000000001`. Now there is one
  👍 emote on this NFT, shown as 👍 from Alice.
- Alice changes her mind, removes thumbs up by sending it again. Now there are 2(👍) on this NFT, no
  👍 is shown on the NFT from Alice.
- Alice talks to artist, she's okay with a thumbs up again, re-sends it. Now there are 3(👍) on this
  NFT, shown as just 👍 from Alice.

### Multiple Emotes

It is perfectly valid for the same user to send multiple emotes to the same NFT. The same rules
about Undoing apply individually to each emote.

### Supported Emotes

There is no limitation to which emotes can be sent - any unicode works. However, it is up to the
individual UIs to decide which ones to show. For example, one UI might be so positivity-oriented
they decide to never show 💩. Others might display some emoji which only exist on certain operating
systems. We leave the choice to the implementers and direct them to emojipedia's stats for most used
emoji: https://emojipedia.org/stats/

Emote spam is generally not a concern because each emote costs a transaction fee.
